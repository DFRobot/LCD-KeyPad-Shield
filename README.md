LCD-KeyPad-Shield
=================

New library for Arduino support the DFR LCD Keypad shield - the
keypad, to be precise. It features an encapsulated namespace, advanced
debouncing (via histogram binning), fast ADC readout, key autorepeat
(with configurable delay and repeat rate), key names and IDs.

The interface is quite simple, litte demo sketch attached.
